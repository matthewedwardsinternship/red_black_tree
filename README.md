This is an interactive demonstration I have created in order to showcase red black tree insertion. A red black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree which uses a system of red nodes and black nodes. Red black trees are defined by a set of four rules.

1. All nodes are either red or black.
2. The root node is always black.
3. The children of a red node are always black.
4. Every node with at least one null child must have the same number of black ancestor nodes.
